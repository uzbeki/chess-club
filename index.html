				<h2 id="history"><b>History of Chess</b></h2>
				<p>The origins of chess are not exactly clear, though most believe 
				it evolved from earlier chess-like games played in India almost 
				two thousand years ago.The game of chess we know today has been 
				around since the 15th century where it became popular in Europe.</p>
				<h2 id="goal"><b>The Goal of Chess</b> </h2>
				<p>Chess is a game played between two opponents on opposite sides 
				of a board containing 64 squares of alternating colors. Each player 
				has 16 pieces: 1 king, 1 queen, 2 rooks, 2 bishops, 2 knights, and 
				8 pawns. The goal of the game is to checkmate the other king. Checkmate 
				happens when the king is in a position to be captured (in check) 
				and cannot escape from capture.</p>

				<h2 id="start"><b>Starting a Game</b></h2>
				<p>At the beginning of the game the chessboard is laid out so that 
				each player has the white (or light) color square in the bottom 
				right-hand side. The chess pieces are then arranged the same way 
				each time. The second row (or rank) is filled with pawns. The rooks 
				go in the corners, then the knights next to them, followed by the 
				bishops, and finally the queen, who always goes on her own matching 
				color (white queen on white, black queen on black), and the king 
				on the remaining square. The player with the white pieces always 
				moves first. Therefore, players generally decide who will get to 
				be white by chance or luck such as flipping a coin or having one 
				player guess the color of the hidden pawn in the other player's 
				hand. White then makes a move, followed by black, then white again, 
				then black and so on until the end of the game.</p>
				<h2><b>How the Pieces Move</b></h2>
				<p>Each of the 6 different kinds of pieces moves differently. Pieces 
				cannot move through other pieces (though the knight can jump over 
				other pieces), and can never move onto a square with one of their 
				own pieces. However, they can be moved to take the place of an opponent's 
				piece which is then captured. Pieces are generally moved into positions 
				where they can capture other pieces (by landing on their square 
				and then replacing them), defend their own pieces in case of capture, 
				or control important squares in the game.</p>
				<h3 id="king" class="figure">The King</h3>
				<p><img alt="The King" src="Images/King.png"> The king is the most 
				important piece, but is one of the weakest. The king can only move 
				one square in any direction - up, down, to the sides, and diagonally. 
				The king may never move himself into <strong>check</strong> (where 
				he could be captured).</p>
				<h3 id="queen" class="figure">The Queen</h3>
				<p><img alt="the Queen" src="Images/queen.png">The queen is the 
				most powerful piece. She can move in any one straight direction 
				- forward, backward, sideways, or diagonally - as far as possible 
				as long as she does not move through any of her own pieces. And, 
				like with all pieces, if the queen captures an opponent's piece 
				her move is over. Click through the diagram below to see how the 
				queens move. Notice how the white queen captures the black queen 
				and then the black king is forced to move. </p>
				<h3 id="rook" class="figure">The Rook</h3>
				<p><img alt="the Rook" src="Images/roolk.png">The rook may move 
				as far as it wants, but only forward, backward, and to the sides. 
				The rooks are particularly powerful pieces when they are protecting 
				each other and working together!</p>
				<br>
				<h3 id="bishop" class="figure">The Bishop</h3>
				<p><img alt="the Bishop" src="Images/bishop.png">The bishop may 
				move as far as it wants, but only diagonally. Each bishop starts 
				on one color (light or dark) and must always stay on that color. 
				Bishops work well together because they cover up each other’s weaknesses.</p>
				<h3 id="knight" class="figure">The Knight</h3>
				<p><img alt="the Knight" src="Images/knight.png">Knights move in 
				a very different way from the other pieces – going two squares in 
				one direction, and then one more move at a 90 degree angle, just 
				like the shape of an “L”. Knights are also the only pieces that 
				can move over other pieces.</p>
				<h3 id="pawn" class="figure">The Pawn</h3>
				<p><img alt="the Pawn" src="Images/pawn.png">Pawns are unusual because 
				they move and capture in different ways: they move forward, but 
				capture diagonally. Pawns can only move forward one square at a 
				time, except for their very first move where they can move forward 
				two squares. Pawns can only capture one square diagonally in front 
				of them. They can never move or capture backwards. If there is another 
				piece directly in front of a pawn he cannot move past or capture 
				that piece.</p>

			<h2>A brief explanation on Food Waste in Japan</h2>
			<p>Every year, Japan produces about 400 million tons of industrial waste 
			and about 50 million tons of household and general commercial waste. 
			Of the household and general commercial waste, about 20 million tons 
			consist of food waste. This is 6 times the weight of used-newspaper 
			waste and 4 times that of discarded automobiles. Now, how much food 
			waste is being recycled? For food waste from the "processing and manufacturing" 
			stage, 48 percent is being recycled. Examples of this include feeding 
			pigs fresh bean curd pressings that are byproducts after making tofu. 
			On the other hand, most food waste from the "distribution" stage is 
			not recycled. Examples include unsold food at supermarkets and lunch 
			boxes and hamburger meat that have passed the expiration date at convenience 
			stores. This is mostly incinerated and sent to landfills. Under Japan's 
			Basic Law for Establishing a Recycling-Based Society, which entered 
			into force in January 2003, the Food Recycling Law took effect in June 
			of the same year. This law's aims are to reduce the amount of food waste 
			generated by food manufacturers and restaurants, and to promote the 
			reuse of food waste such as by turning it into livestock feed and compost.<small><a href="Food%20Waste.html">(see
