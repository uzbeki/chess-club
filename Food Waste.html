	<h1>Food Waste in Japan</h1>
	<p>Every year, Japan produces about 400 million tons of industrial waste and 
	about 50 million tons of household and general commercial waste. Of the household 
	and general commercial waste, about 20 million tons consist of food waste. This 
	is 6 times the weight of used-newspaper waste and 4 times that of discarded 
	automobiles.</p>
	<p>Now, how much food waste is being recycled? For food waste from the "processing 
	and manufacturing" stage, 48 percent is being recycled. Examples of this include 
	feeding pigs fresh bean curd pressings that are byproducts after making tofu.</p>
	<p>On the other hand, most food waste from the "distribution" stage is not recycled. 
	Examples include unsold food at supermarkets and lunch boxes and hamburger meat 
	that have passed the expiration date at convenience stores. This is mostly incinerated 
	and sent to landfills.</p>
	<p>Under Japan's Basic Law for Establishing a Recycling-Based Society, which 
	entered into force in January 2003, the Food Recycling Law took effect in June 
	of the same year. This law's aims are to reduce the amount of food waste generated 
	by food manufacturers and restaurants, and to promote the reuse of food waste 
	such as by turning it into livestock feed and compost.</p>
	<p>Pressed into action by this law, an increasing number food manufacturers 
	and restaurants are working to use food waste as compost. One of those initiatives 
	is by the Hotel New Otani in Tokyo. This hotel previously had a contractor deal 
	with the waste, but today turns not only food waste such as banquet hall leftovers 
	but also used flowers from hotel wedding ceremonies into compost in a composting 
	facility set up below the hotel.</p>
	<p>The compost is used by farmers contracted to grow vegetables, which are then 
	purchased by the hotel. The hotel was able to save the costs it once paid to 
	a waste management company, and recovered the cost of the new in-house composting 
	facility in about 3 years. There are an increasing number of initiatives like 
	this around the country to create a circular flow of materials between producer 
	and consumer.</p>
	<p>Seiyu, a major supermarket chain, was able to reduce the amount of unsold 
	food disposed by about 18 percent just in a year, through such measures as more 
	careful procurement to avoid waste, as well as making unsold food available 
	for employees to purchase before its expiration date, as "ecological discount 
	products."</p>
